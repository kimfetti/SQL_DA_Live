Welcome to SQL for Data Analysis, an O'Reilly live online course. This course teaches you intermediate SQL querying to drive data-driven insights, and I'm proud to be your instructor for this training. 

In this repository, you'll find:
- A .sql file to compile the database for this course, [learning_platform.sql](learning_platform.sql)
- A [database diagram](learning_platform_diagram.pdf) to visualize the learning_platform database

Thank you for joining me for this course, and I welcome your feedback ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kimberlyfessel/), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@KimberlyFessel)). 

Wishing you all the best on your SQL journey! 👍
